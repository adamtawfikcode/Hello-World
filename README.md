Intro to C Programming: Hello World!
What's This All About?
This repository contains a very basic C program. It's perfect if you're just starting out with coding. The program prints some text to your screen. Pretty cool for your first steps in C programming!

The Code
Here's the code you'll see:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    printf("%s %c %d\n", "This is", 'a', 0);

    return 0;
}

Step-by-Step Explanation
The #include <stdio.h> Part:

Think of #include as a way to bring in some extra tools that your code needs. Here, <stdio.h> is like a toolbox for doing stuff with input and output, like showing text on the screen.
The int main(void) Line:

Every C program starts with a main function. It's like the starting point of your program.
int means that when the program ends, you're gonna tell how it went using a number.
(void) is a fancy way of saying "I don't need any extra information to start this program."
Printing "Hello, World!":

printf is a way to show text on the screen.
"Hello, World!\n" is the text to show. \n is a special character to start a new line after saying "Hello, World!".
Printing with Format Specifiers:

This line printf("%s %c %d\n", "This is", 'a', 0); is a bit more complex:
%s, %c, and %d are like placeholders.
%s is replaced by "This is", a string (a bunch of characters).
%c is replaced by 'a', a single character.
%d is replaced by 0, a number (digit).
The return 0; Part:

return 0; is our way of saying "All good, the program ended well!" The 0 is like a thumbs-up to the computer.
Running the Program
To see this code in action, you'll need a C compiler (like GCC). Here's what you do:

Open your command line tool.
Type gcc -o hello hello.c to compile the program.
Then type ./hello to run it. You'll see "Hello, World!" and "This is a 0" on your screen.
Dive In!
Feel free to play around with the text in the printf lines to see different things show up on your screen. Have fun with it!
